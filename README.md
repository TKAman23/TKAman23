- Hi, I’m @TheFinalGuardian
- I’m interested in Game Dev, Art, and logical problems (including math ones)
- I like working on projects in unity, solving coding problems, and studying data structures and algorithms.
- I am currently a noob in github and am still learning the commands and how to use git bash.
- If you would like to contact me, use the e-mail karthikeyaat@gmail.com (I may not respond)
